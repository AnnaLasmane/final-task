                The world of Peaky Blinders is unabashedly cool. It starts off with the theme song: Nick Cave's searing murder ballad, "Red Right Hand." Then, there's the Shelby crime family at the center of the story. Their escapades in post-World War I Birmingham are
                cutthroat to be sure â€” but they also look cool as all get-out. Sometimes, the show feels like an excuse for Cillian Murphy to rain down hellfire in awesome period coats. But the show's writers aren't just in it for the awesomeness. As
                the show unfolds and the Shelby family gains more and more power, things get knotty. Birmingham was a hotbed of leftist organizing, fascist agitation, and conservative crackdowns, after all. Peaky Blinders doesn't shy away from this complexity:
                It revels in its tale of crooked capitalists and bloody resistance. As the Shelby family's fortunes shift and the tides of history pull with more ferocity, Peaky Blinders grows ever more complicated and deep. Saboteurs, moles, and outright
                fanatics abound, and everyone from power-seeking criminals to the officers of the law are out to bring the Shelbys down. We're here to demystify this web of intrigue with this timeline of the entire series.

                Cast your mind back to the very first episode, when we first heard Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein's swirling synth soundtrack and met the aforementioned Dungeons & Dragons-playing best friends. The nerdy but cool Mike, Will, Dustin and Lucas slay imaginary
                monsters from a saturated brown basement in '80s-set Hawkins, Indiana.However, one night, when the crew part ways, the smallest, Will, is attacked by a shadowy monster that's far worse than those found in their dice-rolling game. Will's
                disappearance kicks off the odd events that leave the small town battered and bruised for years to come. </p>
